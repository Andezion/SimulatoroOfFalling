## General Info
I was using SFML framework on C++. Sadly I couldn't install and use it in CLion 'cause of CMake file, so i decided to do it in VisualStudio. As a "brains" goes typical physics laws such as Energy Saving Law or definiton of g or falling system. 

## Technologies
* SFML-2.6.0 for visual part and stuff
* Physics 7 class :)
* Nicolaus Copernicus toes

## Setup
Soon it will be my very first release, so yea, but if you want to use it on Linux or other types of OS - just install SFML using this commands: 
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```
Then you should create your own CMakefile and just copy my code to your file :)
